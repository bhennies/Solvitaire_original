# Supervisor Meeting: 2017-10-24

## Done since last meeting

Worked on rewriting the solving and state representation logic in a more
object-oriented fashion, using abstract classes which could be subclassed for
different game types. Currently all of my state representation is immutable
and is copied between functions (no heap used).

## Discussion Points

### Depth First Search

We spoke about methods of tracking where you've been using depth-first search,
and the efficiency of different implementations.

### Object Orientaiton

We examined some of the problems I was facing using O-O. Specifically, the idea
that I would use different subclasses for different game types. This would mean
that my solver could only handle the preset games, which did not fulfill the
requirement for my solver to be able to handle games described using a game
description language.

## Future Work

- Finish the Black Hole Solver (tidy)
- Rework the OO in the solver to make it more general
- Add a new game to the solver. One without a fixed solution length, but without
  loops.
