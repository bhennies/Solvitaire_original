# Supervisor Meeting: 2017-09-19

## Done since last meeting

### Project initial plan

Created first few Trello backlog tasks for setting up the project.

### Tools / ecosystem plan

Decided on and partially set up project ecosystem for Java

## Discussion Points

The relative merits of implementing the project in Java and C++. It was felt that whilst a different language would probably not make a huge difference a) C++ would run faster and would probably be more suited to the task at hand, and b) it would be a worthwhile endeavor from a personal perspective to improve my C++ skills. Therefor I decided to switch (back) from Java to C++

## Future Work

- Redo my tools/ecosystem plan for C++
- Set up my tools and ecosystem for the project with a template of each element working
- Create a very basic solver for one of the solitaire games
