# Supervisor Meeting: 2017-09-19

## Done since last meeting

### Write first draft of DOER document

First draft completed. See DOER branch for details. Primary, secondary and
tertiary objectives written up and will need discussion with supervisor.

### Create draft JSON schema for describing card games

Draft schema written for describing a number of games from the 250+ Solitaire
app.

## Discussion Points

### DOER form changes

#### Primary objectives:
- Schema/language has been moved to objective 2
- Testing for correctness of classifications has been made into its own
	objective
- Symmetry checking has been added to meta-moves objective
- Objective added for language-level/design optimisations
- Analysis objective moved to end of list of primary objectives

#### Secondary objectives:
- Added need to evaluate as well as implement different types of search
	(objective 2)
- Best-first heuristic objective rewritten to make more sense (given previous
	objective required a basic for of this heuristic anyway)

#### Tertiary objectives:
- Removed MCTS and added solvability ratio objective

### JSON Schema

It was suggested that although it was sensible to limit the number of features
to some reasonable limit, it may be beneficial to make my schema more
expressive, so that almost anything that my implementation could in theory
process, is able to be expressed in my language.

For example, if a game uses 'any suit' to build downwards, that could
actually just be shorthand for the following sequence 'K,Q,J,10,9,8,...',
which can optionally be supplied in full.

## Future Work

- Create project design plan
- Decide on technologies/ecosystem for project
- Create very basic app using the above
