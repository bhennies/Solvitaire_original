# Supervisor Meeting: 2018-02-01

## Done since last meeting

- Added deal description and testing to existing games
- Altered the implementation to make it more efficient
- Added cache symmetries
- Added 7 more games/features to the solver with accompanying tests
- Profiled the code and identified inefficiencies
- Improved performance by changing the way state is cached
- Reduced the size of the cached state to improve performance
- Added multiple versions of application to show effect of certain optimisations

## Discussion Points

Much of the discussion focused on reviewing the work done over the break. Then
attention turned to dominances and the potential for them to improve my solver.
We spoke about the foundations dominance which I still have yet to implement,
as well as a number of black-hole specific dominances, along with one or two
more general ones. I demonstrated the performance of my current solver, and we
spoke about the game Spider, and the challenges of creating a solver that would
work well for that larger 2-deck game.

## Future Work

- Foundations dominance
- Review project objectives
