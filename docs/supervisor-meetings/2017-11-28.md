# Supervisor Meeting: 2017-11-28

## Done since last meeting

### Performance Benchmark script

I've written a script to run my solver on random instances at different
difficulty levels, of several solitaire games, to give me an overview of how
well my solver is performing.

### Basic Optimisations

I've changed the way in which my program stores its own move history so that
it can run with a better theoretical time complexity.

### Code Profiling
I've set up and documented how to run a profiler on my code to identify which
areas are slowing down performance.

## Discussion Points
We discussed in very general terms strategy for improving the internal
representation in my program, and what could be done in terms of caching state.

## Future Work
- Generally over the break, just focus on getting the solver running as
efficiently as possible
