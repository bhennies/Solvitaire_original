# Supervisor Meeting: 2017-11-14

## Done since last meeting

### Completed Canfield
Canfield is completed and there exists a simple variant which my application
can solve.

### Refactor Code
I underwent a major refactoring of my code, in order to a) clean up parts that
were messy/not clear, b) simplify things that were overly complex, and c) make
everything more generic.

### Implement reading rule descriptions from JSON
My solver now reads rule descriptions from a JSON file and runs its solutions
based on those descriptions. These JSON files can either be specified by the
user, or retrieveed internally when one of the presets is specified.

## Discussion Points

We spoke about the possibility of making my JSON representations of game rules
as rich as possible, to allow it to essentially represent anything my solver
can solve. In addition, we discussed further the plan to make deals
representable in JSON too, which I will have to implement before I do my
testing.

In addition, there was discussion of the performance benchmarking, which is now
possible for me to implement properly because I have the JSON rules description
implemented. We also spoke about the best approaches to optimising code. It was
suggested that I focus particularly on data structures and algorithms here,
rather than, say, compiler optimisations etc.

## Future Work

- Create a performance benchmark script
- Implement some basic optimisations for my code
