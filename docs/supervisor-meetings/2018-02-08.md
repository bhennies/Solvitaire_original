# Supervisor Meeting: 2018-02-01

## Done since last meeting

### Foundations dominance

I fixed a bug with some of my game types where it would allow you to move cards
from the foundations when it shouldn't have. I then added this dominance and
adjusted my solver accordingly.

### Review project objectives

See trello card for more details. Still need to type up proper adjusted version
now it has been discussed.

## Discussion Points

- We discussed what would need to be done for games where you can 'worry back',
and how I would implement this.
- We discovered a bug in the way I was caching states which was giving false
results.
- We spoke about the idea of 'streamlining' optimisations in this context.
- We spoke about writing tests to make sure optimisations weren't giving false
results.

## Future Work

- Properly type up adjusted project objectives
- Finish admin and testing for dominance moves
- Implement dominance for 'worrying back' games
- Test performance of this
- Write script for different optimisations to make sure none of them changed
the solvability of games
- Fix caching bug
- Think about 'streamlining' moves and possibly add symmetry flag for this
- Profile code
