# Supervisor Meeting: 2017-11-07

## Done since last meeting

### Add States Searched
When my solver prints out a solution, it now also outputs the number of states
searched.

### Add Free Cell
I have added the game Free Cell to the solver, which involved implementing the
"cell" feature.

### Almost Completed Canfield
I have almost finished adding the game Canfield to the solver, which involves
implementing the "stock/waste" feature, and the "reserve" feature.

## Discussion Points

We spoke about the usefulness of having some kind of script to evaluate at what
"level" my solver can currently solve a range of basic game types. To do this
it may be necessary to implement the feature whereby game rules are interpreted
according to a user-supplied JSON schema.

We also discussed the fact that it might be worth quickly implementing some
kind of hash table to store states seen so far, just because the current
naive implementation has performance so bad it makes the solver painfully slow.

It was also discussed that in the longer term, it would be worth thinking about
some heuristics that might help in getting to correct solutions quicker.

## Future Work

- Finish implementing Canfield
- Add another two games: one to specifically target the stock, and one for the
reserve
- Add some basic unit testing for each "core" game type
- Clean up and refactor the code a little
- Add reading in the game rules from JSON
- Create a performance benchmark script
